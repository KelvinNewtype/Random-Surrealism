## Overview

Random Surrealism is a simple, vanilla web project that uses an HTML5 canvas to generate unique, randomized art on demand. Every time you click the **Weirdify!** button, a new burst of random shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) and a bizarre phrase appears on the canvas. It’s a fun way to experiment with creative coding and embrace the unexpected.

## Features

- **Randomized Visuals:** Each click creates a new, unpredictable combination of shapes and colors.
- **Surreal Phrases:** Enjoy offbeat phrases randomly placed across the canvas.
- **Retro Pixelated Look:** The canvas is styled to maintain a pixelated, retro aesthetic.
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS:** No frameworks—just good old web fundamentals.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-surrealism.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd random-surrealism
   ```

3. **Open the Project:**

   Simply open `index.html` in your web browser by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting “Open with.”

*No build process or dependencies are required—just open and enjoy!*

## Usage

- **Generate Art:** Click the **Weirdify!** button to see your canvas transform into a random collage of shapes and surreal quotes.
- **Refresh for New Ideas:** Each click gives you a brand new piece of art. There’s no limit to the creativity!

## Customization Ideas

- **Animate Your Art:** Use `requestAnimationFrame` to create continuous or reactive animations.
- **Add Sound Effects:** Incorporate the Web Audio API to trigger bizarre sound effects along with the visuals.
- **Tweak the Parameters:** Modify the shape count, color palette, or even add new shapes by editing `script.js`.
- **User Controls:** Build additional controls (sliders, checkboxes) to let users influence randomness.
