# Random Surrealism

**A canvas-based application engineered to procedurally generate unique, abstract artwork. This project demonstrates proficiency in dynamic rendering, front-end state management, and aesthetic implementation using core web technologies.**

This application transforms a user's screen into a customizable visual space, applying rules of controlled randomness to geometry, color theory, and typography.

## 🔑 Technical Capabilities & Features

The project serves as a showcase of competence in several key front-end disciplines:

* **Procedural Geometry Generation:** Utilizes JavaScript to generate fundamental shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) with algorithmic control over positioning and scale.
* **Dynamic State and Rendering:** Employs the HTML5 Canvas API for high-performance, frame-based rendering, enabling the immediate, client-side generation of complex visuals.
* **Vibrant Color Management:** Implements a dynamic color utility to ensure visual harmony while maintaining a vibrant and unpredictable palette for both foreground elements and background.
* **Aesthetic Implementation:** Styling is controlled via CSS, demonstrating:
    * **Retro Pixel Aesthetic:** Achieved through targeted use of the `image-rendering: pixelated` property.
    * **Responsive UI:** Ensures a seamless experience and appropriate canvas scaling across diverse viewport sizes.
* **Content and Output:** Displays contextually relevant, randomly selected text elements and includes a functional feature for image output (downloading the generated canvas as a file).

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The codebase is organized using the standard three-file architecture for clarity and maintainability:

| File | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | Defines the main document structure and hosts the HTML5 canvas element. |
| `style.css` | Controls the layout, typography, and aesthetic properties of the application. |
| `script.js` | Contains the core rendering logic, procedural generation functions, and event handling for user interaction. |

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Local Development)

To initiate local development or testing of the rendering engine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RandomSurrealism.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RandomSurrealism.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd RandomSurrealism
    ```
3.  **Launch:**
    * Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
4.  **Execute:**
    * Interact with the interface controls to trigger the procedural art generation process.
